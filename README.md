# PostgreSQL JDBC Driver for eXist-db

Loadable JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL within eXist-db.

The version number of this package mirrors the version number
of the actual JDBC jar file and is updated through the dependabot
pull requests. The dependency for the JDBC driver utilizes the
`project.version` POM property. When dependabot creates a pull
request to update the JDBC driver's version number, it updates the
project's version number.  When this happens, then a new release
should be created.
